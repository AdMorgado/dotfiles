# dotfiles
My dotfiles, currently for managing ROS and College work,
along side a custom Neovim setup for C++, Rust and Typescript/React work

# Downloading
```
git clone https://github.com/AdMorgado/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
```

#Running it
For initial setups run the ```./bootstrap.sh``` scripts which include installation of packages and other utilities.
If you just wish to update files run the ```./update.sh``` script
